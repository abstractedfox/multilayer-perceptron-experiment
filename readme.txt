This is just an implementation of the example given at https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1237026/Simple-MLP-Backpropagation-Artificial-Neural-Netwo after a professor shared it with me and encouraged me to test it out.

It isn't materially different from the example, it just has naming and comments that (I think) make it a little easier to read
